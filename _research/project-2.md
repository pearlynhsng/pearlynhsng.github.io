Do people lose respect for manager after witnessing others being rude to them? In this research, we hope to understand how viewing others' interactions with a manager or supervisor changes subsequent evaluations of that manager or supervisor. In particular, seeing someone being impertinent may lead to a negative evaluation of that manager's leadership competence while seeing someone being supportive may lead to a positive evaluation of that manager's leadership ability.
