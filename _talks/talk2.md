This study explores how social categorization induces followers to support self-serving leaders. Building on social identity theories, we hypothesize that leader prototypicality leads followers to make inferences with respect to how much they expect to benefit (i.e., subjective expected utility) and this impact follower perceptions of the leaderâ€™s effectiveness and their willingness to support that leader.
